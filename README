#Routing table maintanance
RoutingTable-Node timeout queue if outstanding pings > config.outstanding_ping_threshold and
dht.last_activity > node.last_activity+config.node_timeout then remove node from
routing table and timeout queue

----
#bootstrap & survivor strategy
config[outstanding_ping_questionable_threshold]

On DHT level have a count of questionable nodes and total nodes.

Have questionable flag on node that is set if node.outstanding_pings > config
and node.last_activity+config.node_timeout also DHT.questionable incremented. When ping receive uncheck
questionable decrement and decrement DHT.questionable is node was questionable.

Have the same criteria for inserting new contact and that also determine if
a contact node is questionable in the awake function.

----
#Peer table clean-up
Have a timeout queue of peers order by there timeout time-stamp. Similar to node
the node timeout-queue.

#having self in our own routing table
how to handle this?

#bep42
bep42 assume ip is not nat and create confiming nodeid from that if it sees
that the ip is not correct regenerate nodeid from that external ip insert from
old RoutingTable in new
